The tram stop near the apartment is called Belfiore . In just 3 stops, you’ll arrive near the Duomo; get off at Unita . To return to the apartment, simply take the same tram T2 in the direction of Peretola. The trip takes only 5-8 minutes. For a visual guide, type (linefoto) . Enjoy exploring the city"
